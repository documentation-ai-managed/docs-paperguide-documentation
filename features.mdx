## Document Organization

You structure your documentation using nested pages and custom spaces. Create hierarchies like `/guides/quickstart` or `/api/reference/endpoints` to match your project needs.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Space" icon="folder">
    Navigate to the dashboard and select **New Space**. Name it `Project Docs` and set permissions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Nested Pages" icon="file-text">
    Inside the space, create pages like **Introduction** > **Installation** > **npm**. Drag to reorder.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customize Navigation" icon="menu">
    Enable sidebar menus and table of contents for intuitive browsing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="tip">
  Use spaces for multi-project docs. Limit nesting to three levels for optimal readability.
</Callout>

## Collaboration Tools

Invite team members to co-edit pages. You comment inline, assign tasks, and resolve feedback directly.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Invite Collaborators" icon="user-plus">
    In page settings, add emails or teams. Set roles: **Editor**, **Viewer**, or **Admin**.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Inline Comments" icon="message-circle">
    Highlight text and add `@mentions`. Resolve threads once addressed.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Real-time Edits" icon="edit-3">
    Multiple users edit simultaneously with live cursors and conflict resolution.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Version Control

Every change creates a commit. You view diffs, compare versions, and restore previous states.

<CodeGroup tabs="CLI,UI">
  ```bash
  # Pull latest changes
  paperguide pull --space my-docs

  # Create a new version
  paperguide commit -m "Add API endpoints"
  ```
  ```javascript
  // Programmatic version check
  const client = new PaperguideClient({ apiKey: process.env.API_KEY });
  const versions = await client.getVersions('my-docs');
  console.log(versions[0].diff);
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Expandable title="Advanced Version Workflow" default-open="false">
  Branch pages for experiments: `main` vs `feature-branch`. Merge via pull requests with approval workflows.

  | Action          | Command/Step                  |
  |-----------------|-------------------------------|
  | View History    | Page menu > **Versions**      |
  | Restore Version | Select > **Restore**          |
  | Diff Two Versions | Compare dropdown             |
</Expandable>

## Search and Navigation

Full-text search indexes all content. You filter by space, tag, or type, with fuzzy matching for quick results.
