## What is Paperguide?

Paperguide is a modern documentation platform that helps you create, organize, and publish project documentation with ease. You build structured knowledge bases using MDX, collaborate with your team, and deliver polished docs to users. Unlike traditional wikis, Paperguide offers full Markdown and JSX support, custom themes, and seamless search integration.

This space serves as your central hub for all project docs. Organize content into collections, add version history, and embed interactive components like code examples and diagrams.
